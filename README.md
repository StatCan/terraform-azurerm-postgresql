# Terraform for Azure Managed Database PostgreSQL

Creates a PostgreSQL instance using the Azure Managed Database for PostgreSQL service.

## Security Controls

* Adheres to the [CIS Microsoft Azure Foundations Benchmark 1.3.0](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/governance/policy/samples/cis-azure-1-3-0) for Database Services.

## Dependencies

* Terraform v0.14.x +
* Terraform AzureRM Provider 2.5 +

## Enabling Extensions

Azure Database for PostgreSQL supports a subset of key extensions that are listed in the link below. This information is also available by running `SELECT * FROM pg_available_extensions;`.

For instance, application teams that have functionality that needs encryption can enable pg_crypto by using the `CREATE EXTENSION` command.

## Notes on Collation

The Azure Managed Database for Postgresql is currently using the Windows O.S. As such the collation names are different.

```sh
sudo -u postgres pg_dump -Fp â€”no-owner DBNAME | sed "/COLLATE/s/en_US.utf8/English_United States.1252/ig" | sed "/CREATE COLLATION/s/en_US.utf8/English_United States.1252/ig" | psql --host=aaa.postgres.database.azure.com --port=5432 --username=xxx@yyy --dbname=DBNAME
```
